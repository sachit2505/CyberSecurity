## 🔐 Security

This app uses the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique to hide characters within the pixel data of an image. While it provides stealth, this is a basic technique and can be upgraded with:
- AES-256 encryption
- Password protection
- Multi-layer encoding
- Support for video/audio/text file steganography
